# Divide-and-Conquer approach:
It Breaks a problem into subproblems that are similar to the original problem, recursively solves the subproblems, and finally combines the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem

# Recursion: 
- the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.  
- each recursive call create new frames on the call stack each has it's own local variables and scope. 
- the function calls itself until it reaches the base case. and then teriminates the last call and returns to the previous call LIFO stack.
- number of steps to solve the problem is the number of recursive calls.

<b>
-leafes nodes in the recursion tree is base case.the construction of the tree is the recursive statement. nums of branches is the number of recursive calls.
first call is the left part of the tree
