# Traverse a Tree 
## - Preorder: Root, Left, Right
## - Inorder: Left, Root, Right 
- Postorder: Left, Right, Root
    - when deleting 
    - in mathematical expression, it is called postorder 

## Level Order Traversal 
- traverse each level every time, you can not goes to further level without visits all nodes in this level.

<b>
- inorder traversal of binary search tree is sorted. 
- deleting a node process happen in postorder. left child is deleted first and then right child.
</b>

# Tree Top Down Approach 
- traverse the tree from top to bottom.

# Tree Bottom Up 
- traverse the tree from bottom to top.

# Trees Properties
- ## Symmetric Tree
    - left subtree is mirror image of right subtree. 
    - both trees are empty or both are not.
