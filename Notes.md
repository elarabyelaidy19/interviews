# Binary Tree 

## Binary Trees
- Full Binary Tree
    * leaf nodes have no children, and all other nodes that have children mus have two children. 
- Compplete Binary Tree  
    * complete binary tree are binary heaps. 
    * complete binary tree have all levels filled except the last level.
- Perfect Binary Tree 
    * perfect binary tree have all levels filled and on the same level.
## Traversing Binary Trees 
 - inorder traversal 
    * left, node, right     -> `6 8 9 10 11 12 13`
 - preorder traversal   
    * node, left, right     -> `10 8 6 9 12 11 13` 
 - postorder traversal 
    * left, right, node.    -> `16 9 8 11 13 12 10`
